## Example

The example below will find the element with an id of *my_video* and render a video player into it. 

```js
    // Create a jwplayer instance
	jwplayer('my_video').setup({
		file: '/uploads/example.mp4',
	});

    // Add a custom callback for when user pauses playback
	jwplayer('my_video').onPause(function(event) {
        alert('Why did my user pause their video instead of watching it?');
	});
```

Other callbacks that we provide include
* **onComplete**
* **onSeek**
* **onVolume**
* **[and more](http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/topics/564475-javascript-api/articles)**

You also have the power to programatically set any configuration within the player. 

```js
    function bumpIt() {
        player.setVolume( player.getVolume() + 10 );
    }
```
